# Paint Picker

Home renovation is not easy and very time consuming activity. Choosing the right interior paint color is not easy as well and could be a real nightmare.
This repository is not about choosing right paint colors or color schemas for your home. 
This repository could help in finding color code/name in palettes of paint companies that matches the color you choose.

[IMPORTANT]

Colors and images shown on your display may not represent the true color. Always use paint testers/samples before committing whole amount paints.
